# Agrobiodiversity Simulation

## About
This is a project I am doing at my Master in Complex System at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), regarding emergence and maintenance of agrobiodiversity in traditional communities. This project will analyse three different dynamics, to study their importance for agrobiodiversity: the social dynamics (ex. seed exchange networks), biologic dynamics (ex. productivity, adaptivity) and the individual criteria for seed selection (ex. cultural importance, size of useful parts). For more information consult this [Master's Project](Masters_Project.pdf) (in portuguese). To see preliminar results see [results](results/).
