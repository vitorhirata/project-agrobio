# Agrobiodiversity Simulation

## About
This is a project I am doing at my Master in Complex System at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo (USP), regarding emergence and maintenance of agrobiodiversity in traditional communities. This project will analyse three different dynamics, to study their importance for agrobiodiversity: the social dynamics (ex. seed exchange networks), biologic dynamics (ex. productivity, adaptivity) and the individual criteria for seed selection (ex. cultural importance, size of useful parts). For more information consult this [Master's Project](Masters_Project.pdf) (in portuguese).

## Tests
There is a file with tests of the model simulation, with the data generated and images of that. In the data file it is also presented the parameters used and additional information.

## Future Steps
- Make a plot file in python or julia.
- Fix and comment the tests part.
- Start social model.
