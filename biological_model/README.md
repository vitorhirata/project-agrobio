# Biological Model

This model takes into account a biological model for the study of biodiversity, based on: de Souza JÃºnior, Misael B., Fernando F. Ferreira, and Viviane M. de Oliveira. *Effects of the spatial heterogeneity on the diversity of ecosystems with resource competition.* Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications 393 (2014): 312-319. doi:[10.1016/j.physa.2013.08.045](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2013.08.045).

## Examples
There is a file with tests of the model simulation, with the data generated and images of that. In the data file it is also presented the parameters used and additional information.

## TODO
- Implement tests.
- Improve comments.
