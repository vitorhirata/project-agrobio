# Social Model

This model takes into account the social dynamics for the study of agrobiodiversity. Still in implementation.

## TODO
- Improve comments and code readability.
- Improve propriety::chooseSpecie method, maybe using decision theory.
- Search about the correct value of MUTATIONPROB and update it.
- Use some risk model and add this property to each specie.
- Read more case studies.
